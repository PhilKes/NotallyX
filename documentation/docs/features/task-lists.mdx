## Creating a Task List

1. Tap the '✅'' button in the bottom right corner
2. Start typing your first item
3. Tap Enter to add a new item
4. Continue adding items as needed

## Managing Tasks

### Checking and Unchecking Tasks

- Tap the checkbox next to an item to mark it as complete
- Tap again to uncheck it
- By default, checked items are automatically moved to the bottom of the list

### Deleting Tasks

Click the trash icon on the right of the item you want to delete

### Moving Tasks

- Long press on the 2 horizontal lines on the left of the item you want to move to enter drag mode
- Drag the item to its new position
- Release to place the item

## Working with Subtasks

Subtasks allow you to create hierarchical task lists, which is useful for breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
To make an item a subtask simply swipe it right, or to undo it swipe it left.

## Advanced List Features

### Auto-Sorting

By default, NotallyX automatically sorts your task lists by moving checked items to the bottom. You can customize this behavior:

1. Open the app settings
2. Navigate to "Behaviour" section
3. Tap "Sort List items" and choose the desired behaviour

### Bulk Actions

NotallyX provides several options for managing multiple tasks at once.
To access them inside of a task list note, tap the "..." in the bottom right corner:
- **Delete checked items**: Tap the three-dot menu and select "Delete checked"
- **Check All items**
- **Uncheck All items**

### Moving Groups of Tasks

You can move a parent task along with all its subtasks:

1. Long press on the parent task
2. Drag to the desired position
3. Release to place the entire group

### Convert to Text note

If you want to convert your task list into a regular text note:

1. Tap the "..." in the bottom right corner
2. Tap "Convert to Text Note"
3. For every task item a line of text will be added to the text note
