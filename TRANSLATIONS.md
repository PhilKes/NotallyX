# Translations

All translations are crowd sourced.
To contribute:
1. Download current [translations.xlsx](https://github.com/PhilKes/NotallyX/raw/refs/heads/main/app/translations.xlsx)
2. Open in Excel/LibreOffice and add missing translations
   Notes:
    - Missing translations are marked in red
    - You can filter by key or any language column values
    - Non-Translatable strings are hidden and marked in gray, do not add translations for them
    - For plurals, some languages need/have more quantity strings than others, if a quantity string in the default language (english) is not needed the row is highlighted in yellow. If your language does not need that quantity string either, ignore them.
3. Open a [Update Translations Issue](https://github.com/PhilKes/NotallyX/issues/new?assignees=&labels=translations&projects=&template=translation.md&title=%3CINSERT+LANGUAGE+HERE%3E+translations+update)
4. I will create a Pull-Request to add your updated translations
